# project
The basic idea of our project mainly focusses on voice based applications for blind people. one of the thing we are intrested to work on is email for blind people as E-mails are considered to be the most reliable way of communication over Internet, for sending or receiving some important information. The main benefit of this system is that the use of keyboard is completely eliminated, the user will have to respond through voice and mouse click only. The UI or the user interface of the project is developed by designing of the web pages which the user will use to interact. Login is done through voice recognition. After successful login, user will be redirected to home page and this is the main page from where user can perform all the activities like, compose a new mail, check inbox,check starred mails etc. The user can use mouse for performing some of these activities. logout can alsobe done based on voice recognition.
